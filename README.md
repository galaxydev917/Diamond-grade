Sorts App
Sorting the excellence from the excellent

## Getting Started

Like most flutter apps:

git clone go into the directory

Start the simulator by running open -a Simulator then flutter run

If there are issues, flutter clean. If needs by go and check the code signing in Xcode depending on the error messages

You might want to delete the Podfile (rm ios/Podfile) and have it recreated on build

## What it does
The app works in two ways:
1. By taking a manual input of a diamonds dimensions. The app gives a form to the customer to enter dimensions then calculates the Sorts rating
2. GIA lookup. The App given a GIA number will give back a Sorts rating for the diamond
